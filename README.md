## Introduction
SecureNetGuard is a Python-based tool designed to detect and stop malicious packets of data on a network. It utilizes feature engineering, statistical analysis, and various types of classifiers to identify malicious traffic. This project was created as a prototype for corporations and individuals who want to contribute to the cybersecurity world.

## Name Meaning
SecureNetGuard is derived from the words "secure" and "netguard." The first word implies that the tool is designed to provide a secure environment for networks, while the second word implies that the tool is used to guard networks from malicious activity.

## Goals
- [x] Create a prototype
- [ ] Develop a machine learning algorithm to detect malicious packets
- [ ] Utilize feature engineering to identify malicious traffic
- [ ] Incorporate statistical analysis to identify malicious traffic
- [ ] Develop a variety of classifiers to detect malicious traffic
- [ ] Utilize Python libraries such as SciKit Learn, Tensor Flow, and Pandas
- [ ] Create an open source alternative to any closed-source APIs

## Roadmap
1. Create a prototype
2. Develop a machine learning algorithm to detect malicious packets
3. Utilize feature engineering to identify malicious traffic
4. Incorporate statistical analysis to identify malicious traffic
5. Develop a variety of classifiers to detect malicious traffic
6. Utilize Python libraries such as SciKit Learn, Tensor Flow, and Pandas
7. Create an open source alternative to any closed-source APIs

## Features
SecureNetGuard is designed to provide the following features:

- Feature engineering to identify malicious traffic
- Statistical analysis to identify malicious traffic
- A variety of classifiers to detect malicious traffic
- Utilization of Python libraries such as SciKit Learn, Tensor Flow, and Pandas
- An open source alternative to any closed-source APIs

## Unique Points
SecureNetGuard is unique in that it:

- Utilizes feature engineering, statistical analysis, and various types of classifiers to detect and stop malicious traffic
- Is a prototype intended to be built upon to make it into what it was designed to become
- Was mainly created as a prototype for corporations and individuals who want to contribute to the cybersecurity world
- Has the potential to greatly help the cybersecurity world

## Requirements
SecureNetGuard is a prototype and will likely need to be updated to run on the reader's own machine, with URLs and possible keys needing to be updated as well.
